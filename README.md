# ThreadSynchronizationInJava

A simple learning project that demonstrates ways to solve such multithreading problems as race conditions, deadlocks, and producer-consumer problem.

The project forms the basis of the following tutorials:
1. [What is a Race Condition in Java, and how it can be prevented using synchronized and AtomicInteger](https://dev.to/danielrendox/what-are-race-conditions-in-java-and-how-to-solve-them-with-synchronized-and-atomicinteger-111m)
2. [How to solve the producer-consumer problem in Java](https://dev.to/danielrendox/how-to-solve-the-producer-consumer-problem-in-java-vivid-example-multithreading-5fpj)
